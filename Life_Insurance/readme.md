## **Step 1: Understanding Life Insurance**

### **What is Life Insurance?**

Life insurance is a contract between you (the policyholder) and an insurance company. In exchange for regular premium payments, the insurer provides a **death benefit** (a lump sum of money) to your beneficiaries when you pass away.

**Why Do People Buy Life Insurance?**

-   Replace lost income for dependents
-   Pay off debts (mortgage, loans, credit cards)
-   Cover funeral and end-of-life expenses
-   Build wealth or leave an inheritance
-   Fund business continuity plans
-   Provide financial security for loved ones

**Who Are the Key Players in Life Insurance?**

-   **Policyholder** – The person who owns the life insurance policy
-   **Insured** – The person whose life is insured (may be the same as the policyholder)
-   **Beneficiary** – The person(s) or entity that receives the payout
-   **Insurance Company** – The company that provides the policy and pays out claims
-   **Insurance Agent/Broker** – Helps the policyholder choose a suitable policy
-   **Underwriter** – Evaluates risk and determines premiums
